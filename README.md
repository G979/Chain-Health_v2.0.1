	There are two main user types, 
(1) the health entities which are health Organizations, doctors, or individuals, and 
(2) the CoA which plays the role of the entity that controls and guarantees network transactions.

	In Chain-Health, each user has their own address, which is linked to specific roles and privileges. CoA, Doctor, Hospital, and Patient are the roles that are supported in this implementation.

	Any user can create a new account or login to one of his or her existing accounts to gain access to and use the services offered.

	The campaigns are the main component of the proposed prototype. They each have their own address, which is used to identify a patient in the system. 

	CoA has the authority to conduct campaigns. Users can participate in campaigns based on their roles and privileges.

	The exchanges that take place between the parties involved in each campaign are referred to as requests. Each data transaction is counted as one request by the platform. 

	Users can submit requests. CoA has the authority to accept or reject a request, and every request results in a transaction. In Ethereum's immutable layer, all transaction data is stored in the form of blocks.
